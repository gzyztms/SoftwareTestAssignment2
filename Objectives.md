####<center>(Functional testing)</center>

###1. Objective
In this assignment, you will use JUnit to perform the functional tests.


###2. Assignment Description
Q1. Please implement a function that can calculate the next date based on the input date.  The date is in the form of Year-Month-Day, where year is represented by 4 digits, month is represented by 2 digits, and day is represented by 2 digits.


Q2. Please implement a function that can determine the volume of a cube which use 3 integers to represent length, width and height. The range of length is [2,100], the range of width is [5,200], and the range of hegith is [20,80].


Q3. You need to implement programs that can generate test cases for the functions in Q1 and Q2 respectively, according to Boundary Value Analysis, Robustness Testing, Worst-Case, and Robust Worst Case and Strong Normal Equivalence Class Testing and Strong Robust Equivalence Class Testing criteria.


Q4. You need to use the generated test cases in Q3 to test your programs in Q1 and Q2.

###3. Deliverables:
Report: Write a technical report that includes your answers to questions 1-4. Note that in addition to the correctness of your answers, the structure and quality of the report itself will also be evaluated.

Source code with test cases: Export your Eclipse project (including the source code and your JUnit tests) as a zip file.

###4. Submission:
Archive both deliverables into a single zip file.
